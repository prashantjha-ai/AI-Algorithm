Findings from EDA:

Temperature and Hour have a strong correlation with the count of rented bikes.

Dew point temperature is highly positively correlated to the Temperature.

There is a significant drop in the number of rented bikes during Winters(Dec-Feb) because it's freezing cold!

The demand for bikes increases during warmer temperatures,which is why there's maximum count of rented bikes during the Summer season.

In all seasons,the peak demands for rental bikes occur on the opening (8-9 AM) and closing times (6-7pm) of offices and institutions.

Conclusion Based on Model Evaluation:

An adjusted R2 score of 0.91 was obtained.

Temperature and Hour were found to be most influential variables in predicting the hourly demand for rental bikes.

When compared to other models used, decision tree-based models have performed well.
